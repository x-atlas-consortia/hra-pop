#		Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.	An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.	Analytes are the target molecules being measured with the assay.	Each assay is placed into one of the following 4 general categories: generation of images of microscopic entities, identification & quantitation of molecules by mass spectrometry, imaging mass spectrometry, and determination of nucleotide sequence.	The specific type of assay being executed.	Position(s) in the read at which the cell barcode starts.	Which read file contains the cell barcode	Length of the cell barcode in base pairs					Start date and time of assay, typically a date-time stamped folder generated by the acquisition instrument. YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month with leading 0s, and DD is the day with leading 0s, hh is the hour with leading zeros, mm are the minutes with leading zeros.		Specifies whether or not a specific molecule(s) is/are targeted for detection/measurement by the assay.	Is this a sequencing replicate?		Adapter sequence to be used for adapter trimming	Average size in basepairs (bp) of sequencing library fragments estimated via gel electrophoresis or bioanalyzer/tapestation.	A link to the protocol document containing the library construction method (including version) that was used.	Units of final library yield	Total number of ng of library after final pcr amplification step. This is the concentration (ng/ul) * volume (ul)	An id for the library. The id may be text and/or numbers	Whether the library was generated for single-end or paired end sequencing	Number of PCR cycles to amplify cDNA	Number of PCR cycles performed for library indexing			Name of the person responsible for executing the assay.	Email address for the operator.		Name of the principal investigator responsible for the data.	Email address for the principal investigator.	DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for this assay.		Number of cell/nuclei input to the assay	The kit used for the RNA sequencing assay	Total number of cell/nuclei yielded post dissociation and enrichment	The method by which specific cell populations are sorted or enriched.	The type of single cell entity derived from isolation protocol	Link to a protocols document answering the question: How were single cells separated into a single-cell suspension?	A quality metric by visual inspection prior to cell lysis or defined by known parameters such as wells with several cells or no cells. This can be captured at a high level.	The method by which tissues are dissociated into single cells in suspension.	Percent PhiX loaded to the run	Slash-delimited list of the number of sequencing cycles for, for example, Read1, i7 index, i5 index, and Read2.	Q30 is the weighted average of all the reads (e.g. # bases UMI * q30 UMI + # bases R2 * q30 R2 + ...)	Reagent kit used for sequencing	External source (outside of HuBMAP) of the project, eg. HCA (The Human Cell Atlas Consortium).
